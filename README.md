# Data Structures and Algorithms in Java

This repository contains Java implementations of various data structures and algorithms commonly used in computer science. The goal is to demonstrate how different data structures work and how algorithms can be applied to solve problems efficiently. The repository includes a variety of examples, from basic data structures like arrays and linked lists to more advanced algorithms such as sorting and searching.

## Contents:
- **Data Structures:**
  - Arrays
  - Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly)
  - Stacks
  - Queues
  - Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees)
  - Heaps
  - Graphs

- **Algorithms:**
  - Sorting (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
  - Searching (Linear Search, Binary Search)
  - Graph Algorithms (BFS, DFS)
  - Dynamic Programming (Knapsack Problem, Fibonacci)
  - Recursion (Factorial, Tower of Hanoi)
  
## Features:
- Understand the implementation and functionality of common data structures.
- Learn various algorithmic techniques and their applications.
- Visualize the execution of algorithms with code examples.
- Improve problem-solving skills by exploring algorithmic solutions.

## Installation:

To use these implementations, clone or download the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ghulammustafa603/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-in-Java.git
